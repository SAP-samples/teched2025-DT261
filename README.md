## 💬Description

This repository contains the material for the SAP TechEd 2025 session **DT261 - Build on-stack extensions with ABAP Cloud in SAP Cloud ERP**.

**Developer extensibility as defined by SAP basically encompasses two main activities.**

1. Develop custom code to implement your own business logic.   

   Here you can make use of existing API's from SAP that have been released for that purpose.
   
3. Extend an existing RAP Business Object so that additional business functionality is added.

   Such an extensible RAP business object will usually reside in another software components or it is an existing extensible RAP BO that has been delivered by SAP or a SAP partner.  
   By extending the funcitionality of an existing RAP Business object its functionality can be adapted to your specific business requirements.

## 🗺️ Overview

**This session provides an introduction to the ABAP RESTful Application Programming Model (RAP) and explores how it can be effectively leveraged in application development."**

## 🛠️ Exercises

The main aspect of developer extensibility is the option to extend an extensible RAP business object that has been delivered by SAP or a SAP partner.

| Overview | -- |
| ------------- | -- |
| [Exercise: Getting Started: Connect and Logon](exercises/ex00/README.md) | Logon to your S/4HANA Public Cloud system. |
| [Exercise 1: Extend the behavior of a RAP business object (determinations, validations, side-effects)](exercises/ex01/README.md) | You will _extend the behavior_ of the base RAP business object that has been already pre-generated by your instructor. You will learn how extend the behavior of the base RAP BEO by validations, determinations and side effects.  |
| [Exercise 2: Extend the CDS data model of the extensible RAP base business object](exercises/ex02/README.md) | You will then continue to _extend the data model_ with additional fields  |
| [Exercise 3: Extend the business object with an action](exercises/ex03/README.md) | You will continue to _extend the behavior_ of the base RAP business object by adding an action. Since actions can only added via an extension to fields that have been added itself via an extension, adding an action via an extension must be performed after Exercise 2 |
